Project Layout

I have created a website already, tho just using wordpress and widgets. It's currently hosted at my friend's server

https://capecod-getaway.com/

Ultimately the following is my plan for the project using react, express and mySQL

Home Page: Featured vacation home with descriptions and photo gallery.  Email address on the page
Review page: Pulling data from mySQL with table of contacts of prior guests who stayed
    1. Will show guest's first name and initial of last name
    2. Town/state they are from
    3. Month/Year they stayed
    4. Review

In MongoDB
Contacts table
1. First Name
2. Last Name
3. Email Address
4. Address of Town, State
5. Phone number
6. Month/Year they stayed
6. Review

# Create an App using Express and React from Scratch

Let's goooooo!

## Why

Watching videos, listening to instructors, reading tutorials online, and any actions that do not consist of you writing code will only get you so far. To be a successful programmer, you need lots of daily hands-on practice. Solving lots of code challenges.  Work on at least one personal project.

## How

You will review what you know and apply it to building your own app.

- Express for your API
- Mongo for your db
- React for your front-end

Use the slide decks and the previous repositories as your help to complete the coding steps.

Ask your group, any TAs, the instructor, etc for any help you need. We're in this together to all be full stack developers that can create any app we can dream of.

## All Together

Setup a personal mongodb in the cloud

## Instructions

### Step 1

Identify an app you want to build.

Ideas

- Your favorite hobby
- -> cooking, sewing, baking, running, shopping, skiing

- Your Job
- -> Tracking projects, issues, data, etc

- Charity
- Track charities or identify an app charities may need

- Anything! at all can be used for your app idea

## Step 2

NOTE: Commit to git early and often. Push to your personal repository often.

Create your PR early as early as you can.

Create an express api

Create http files to test your api

## Step 3

NOTE: Commit to git early and often. Push to your personal repository often, especially before each step.

Create a react UI

Create test files for your UI (more on this this week!)

## Step 4

NOTE: Commit to git early and often. Push to your personal repository often, especially before each step.

Deploy your app to the world (more on this this week!)
