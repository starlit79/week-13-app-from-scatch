# Create an App using Express and React from Scratch

Let's goooooo!

## Why

Watching videos, listening to instructors, reading tutorials online, and any actions that do not consist of you writing code will only get you so far. To be a successful programmer, you need lots of daily hands-on practice. Solving lots of code challenges.  Work on at least one personal project.

## How

You will review what you know and apply it to building your own app.

- Express for your API
- Mongo for your db
- React for your front-end

Use the slide decks and the previous repositories as your help to complete the coding steps.

Ask your group, any TAs, the instructor, etc for any help you need. We're in this together to all be full stack developers that can create any app we can dream of.

## All Together

Setup a personal mongodb in the cloud
