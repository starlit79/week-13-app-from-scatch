    <h3>Our House</h3>
    <p>Our house is the perfect Cape Cod Get-A-Way in a quaint neighborhood in West Yarmouth.  The house is  just off of Historic Route 28 in West Yarmouth located 1.5 miles from Seagull Beach.  
       You are walking distance to many nearby restaurants such as Basil Thai, Jerry’s, Captain Parker’s and Red Face Jacks.2020 Newly refinished wood floor and new bathroom floors for your comfort and enjoyment.</p>

       <p>It features 5 bedrooms, 3 queen bedrooms, and 2 twin rooms.
       
       This home is an ideal rental for any group: Allowing a Large Family or 2-3 smaller Families to vacation together and even with the grand parents! Also great for a Golf Outing with or without the whole gang; or the perfect summer Family Reunion.
       
       The 5 bedrooms are well laid out with 3 Queen Beds, 6 Twin Beds, and 1 Queen Sleeper Sofa. Bring your own sheets, towels and pillow cases. 
       
       <p>2 full bathrooms and an Outdoor Shower. Washer & Dryer. Central Heat and Air Conditioning. WiFi and Basic Cable. For your convenience, we do provide hand soap, Dial shampoo and body wash 2 in 1, ingredients will be in the guest book or can provide via message upon request.
       
       Large kitchen has a breakfast nook, dishwasher, stove and microwave. The dining room is just off the kitchen and looks out to the big back yard (1/3 acre). Great living room with gorgeous fireplace.</p>
       
       <p>Our house is in a great location to take advantage of all that Cape Cod has to offer. It is close to the beach which is key, but it also has a great yard and a lot of room to relax at the house or enjoy the summer breeze on the deck. The Outdoor Shower is perfect for rinsing off after the beach or an al fresco experience you can’t get at home. We are only 1.5 hours from downtown Boston, so it easy to get away without an extended drive to the outer regions of the Cape. But, we are in the center of everything you could want to Cape Cod – Shopping, Restaurants, Pirate Museum, Mini Golf, Trampolines, Pirate’s Cove, Beaches, Bars, Ice Cream, and of course the Christmas Tree Shops!</p>
